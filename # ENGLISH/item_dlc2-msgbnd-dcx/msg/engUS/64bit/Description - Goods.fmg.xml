<text id="272">Potently medicinal moss clump with a flower.
Reduces poison and toxin. Cures ailments.

<text id="301">An urn filled with crystal-clear water.
Originally intended as a soothing potion,
this water scalds the skin of Undead and Hollows.

<text id="2064">My king, 

I have done as you asked. The pontiff allowed us entry into this forlorn place, our prison, and already the knights have begun to turn. Their minds become twisted and their features unrecognizable. I too can feel it gnawing.

The pontiff lent us his outriders that they may be our jailers. I fear though that they may be less human than us. If they can't protect the world from what we will become, the crystal may be our last hope. 

I know not how this letter may reach you, or if yet you still live, but know that I did all I could. Please, my king, don't let our city crumble. 

Give my love to Aava.

- White: vulnerable to Physical attacks.
- Red: vulnerable to Fire attacks.
- Blue: vulnerable to Magic attacks.
- Orange: vulnerable to Lightning attacks.
- Purple: vulnerable to Dark attacks.

Having discovered this, I have lured the creature into a vacant room within the castle and departed for the cemetary.'</text>
